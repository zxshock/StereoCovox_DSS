Stereo Covox (Stereo-on-1) with "Disney Sound Source" support, Mono-on-2 as fallback option via switch. USB jack for power supply, includes small amplifier.
Older project (from 2015) which started as a "DSS dongle" which one would put between the LPT port and a mono Covox to add DSS support and got semi-finalized in 2021.
Prototype in 2018 has a number of errors and bugs (see prev.png), proposed fixes were never prototyped. Maybe some day.

A device suspeciously close with some additional features is also available commercially on eBay.
